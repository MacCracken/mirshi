## [Unreleased]

0.6.0 — Hardening (in progress): the supervisor against a misbehaving / hostile child.

### Added
- **Host-resource bounds** (`src/limits.cyr`): kernel-enforced rlimits set on the
  child before `execve` cap the two exhaustion vectors reachable through the
  translated surface — `RLIMIT_AS` = 1 GiB bounds an `mmap#27` storm, `RLIMIT_NOFILE`
  = 256 bounds an `open#7` / `dup#8` storm. A storm degrades to the agnos failure
  sentinel (`mmap#27` → 0, `open#7`/`dup#8` → -1), never a supervisor crash or host
  OOM. Set after `PTRACE_TRACEME`, before the seccomp filter (so `prlimit64` needs no
  allowlist entry and the child can't raise its own limits); always on, independent
  of `--no-seccomp`. The PID/process vector needs no rlimit — the seccomp allowlist
  has no `clone`/`fork` and `spawn#3` is `ENOSYS`, so a process storm is structurally
  impossible. [ADR 0006](docs/adr/0006-host-resource-bounds-child-rlimits.md).
- **Fault-injection harness wired into CI** (`scripts/it/fault_inject.sh`): the 0.6.0
  hardening gate now runs in CI (after the M2 step). Adds a memory-exhaustion
  (`mmap#27` storm) and an fd-exhaustion (`open#7` storm) case to the existing
  bad-pointer / SIGSEGV / unknown-syscall / syscall-storm / spawn cases; all assert
  the supervisor stays stable and the host is untouched.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-06-29

M4 — seccomp-notify feasibility + benchmark baseline (the full migration reframed).

### Added
- **Benchmark baseline** — `scripts/bench/bench_syscall.sh` (mechanism-agnostic:
  a `seccomp-notify` row slots in unchanged later) + `docs/benchmarks.md`. The
  ptrace path measures **~30 µs per trapped+translated syscall** (~100× native on
  a `getpid` storm, but only ~5× native on a realistic `cat` of a 4 MB file — the
  per-syscall tax dominates only syscall-dense work). Wired as a non-gating CI step.
- [ADR 0005](docs/adr/0005-seccomp-notify-feasibility.md) — the durable finding
  that seccomp-notify **cannot renumber a syscall** (its response is
  `{id,val,error,flags}`) and therefore cannot do `mmap`-in-child, so a *full*
  replacement of the ptrace loop (M4-as-written) is impossible. The realistic M4
  is a **hybrid** (notify for the emulatable hot path, ptrace for the
  `mmap`/renumber residue) — documented and **deferred by data** (realistic
  workloads are ~5× native, so the hybrid's complexity is not yet justified).
  Also records the `FLAG_CONTINUE` TOCTOU rule (emulate every pointer/buffer
  syscall from one supervisor-side copy; never read-decide-then-CONTINUE).

## [0.4.0] — 2026-06-29

M3 — the Docker vehicle. agnos userland runs in a plain container, no QEMU.
This completes the functional v1 surface (direction-1 headless CLI, M0–M3).

### Added
- **M3 — the Docker vehicle + multi-container fan-out** (the v1 vehicle): agnos
  userland runs in a plain container, **no QEMU**.
  - `docker/Dockerfile` — a **`FROM scratch`** image (~58 KB) carrying mirshi +
    agnos-target static ELFs + a tiny rootfs, `ENTRYPOINT ["/mirshi"]`. Static
    no-libc binaries → no base OS, no shell, structurally no QEMU.
  - `docker/{build,fanout,smoke}.sh` + `docker/tools/*.cyr` (hello/catfile/ls/echo)
    — build the image, run agnos tools (`docker run agnos-mirshi /bin/hello`),
    demonstrate N-container fan-out, and a CI smoke gate (proves no qemu in the
    image). Wired into CI after the M2 step.
  - **Bounding seccomp policy** (`src/seccomp.cyr`): mirshi installs a classic-BPF
    allowlist on the child (after `PTRACE_TRACEME`, before `execve`, with
    `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`) capping it to the syscalls the translation emits;
    anything else is `SIGSYS`-killed. Default-on in run mode, `--no-seccomp`
    opt-out, off in trace mode. The default-deny completeness proof is 0.7.0.
  - `mirshi` CLI: `mirshi [--selftest-trace] [--no-seccomp] <agnos-elf>`.
  - [ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-docker-vehicle-bounding-seccomp.md) + the
    [fan-out guide](docs/guides/docker-fanout.md). ADR 0004 records the
    load-bearing finding that **seccomp is evaluated after the ptrace rewrite**
    (so the filter allowlists mirshi's *output* syscalls, not the agnos input).

## [0.3.0] — 2026-06-29

M2 — filesystem syscalls. agnos coreutils-class tools read+write a real fs, no QEMU.

### Added
- **M2 filesystem syscalls** — agnos `cat`/`cp`/`ls`/`stat`-class tools now read+
  write a real fs under mirshi (no QEMU). Adds 13 fs translations:
  `open#7` (`AO_*`→`O_*` flags + synthesized mode), `close#6`, `read#5`/`write#1`
  (M1), `lseek#58`, `dup#8`, `mkdir#9`, `rmdir#10`, `unlink#30`, `rename#31`,
  `link#32` (hardlink), `stat#33`, `getdents#29`.
  - `src/scratch.cyr` — child red-zone path staging: `process_vm_readv`/`writev`
    wrappers + `stage_at` (writes the NUL-terminated path below the stopped
    child's `rsp`, short-transfer-guarded). The fs calls execute in-child so the
    kernel reads the staged path natively.
  - `src/dispatch.cyr` — the fs handlers (single-path, two-path register MOVE for
    `rename`/`link`, and the `stat`/`getdents` exit-stop output repack).
  - `src/translate.cyr` — pure helpers: `ao_to_o`, `dtype_to_agnos`, the
    `stat` 144 B→48 B repack, the `getdents` Linux→agnos dirent repack, + the fs
    number map. Unit-tested (41 new assertions; 105 total).
  - `tests/fixtures` via `scripts/it/m2_fs.sh` — sandboxed fs integration test
    asserting HOST EFFECTS (file created/content, cp `cmp`, dir created, rename/
    hardlink, unlink, stat fields, dir listing). Wired into CI after the M1 step.
  - [ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-fs-redzone-path-staging.md) — why red-zone path
    staging + exit-stop repack (not injected-mmap, not supervisor-side fs).
- Known gaps (documented): transparent path pass-through (rootfs isolation is M3,
  `..`/symlink-escape hardening is 0.7.0); `getdents` drops records past the agnos
  buffer; `getdents` ino truncated u64→u32.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-06-29

M1 — core translation. agnos binaries run as native Linux processes, no QEMU.

### Added
- **M1 core translation (process + console)** — mirshi's default mode now
  TRANSLATES + EXECUTES agnos syscalls so an agnos-compiled binary runs as a
  native Linux process (no QEMU). `mirshi <agnos-elf>` runs it; `--selftest-trace`
  keeps the M0 trap-log mode. Acceptance met: an agnos `hello` (write+exit) and a
  stdin `cat` run correctly, exit codes propagate, and a heap fixture proves
  `mmap#27` is executed in-child (the M0→M1 segfault gate).
  - `src/translate.cyr` — PURE agnos→Linux translation: the number remap, the
    number-aware return mapping (`-errno`→`-1`, but `mmap#27`/`time_unix#46`
    failure→0), the 2 MB mmap round-up, and the 6-arg mmap register synthesis.
    Unit-tested (39 new assertions; 64 total).
  - `src/dispatch.cyr` — the impure dispatcher: execute-in-child (rewrite
    `orig_rax`+args, kernel runs it in the child) for `write#1`/`read#5`/
    `getpid#2`/`mmap#27`/`munmap#28`/`sync#12`/`getrandom#45`/`time_unix#46`;
    supervisor-emulate (`uptime_ms#40` via shared `clock_gettime`, `sleep_ms#41`)
    via the `orig_rax=-1` skip + injected return; `exit#0`→real `exit_group`.
  - `src/intercept.cyr` — split into `_trace_log` (M0 `PTRACE_SYSEMU`) and
    `_trace_run` (M1 `PTRACE_SYSCALL` enter/exit loop), sharing `_attach`.
  - `tests/fixtures/{hello,cat,exit42,heapuser}.cyr` + `scripts/it/m1_run.sh` —
    the real translate+execute integration gate (wired into CI after the M0 step).
  - [ADR 0002](docs/adr/0002-execute-in-child-translation.md) — why
    execute-in-child via `PTRACE_SYSCALL` register rewrite (not SYSEMU+rip-rewind,
    not pure supervisor-emulate).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-29

M0 — scaffold + the trap loop. Interception proven *before* translation.

### Added
- Initial project scaffold (`cyrius init --bin --agent`, pin 6.3.5).
- Project identity: **mirror-shim** — bidirectional AGNOS↔Linux syscall-ABI
  translation (userland pico-process supervisor, NOT kernel emulation / VM).
  Activated from the idea-log ([[project_tools_stable_ideas]]) per the "earns its
  own memory file + planning doc when it activates" note.
- Architecture map in `src/main.cyr` (intercept → translate → emulate) + the
  first-few-cycles roadmap toward **v1 = AGNOS + mirshi runs in a plain Docker
  container, no QEMU** (direction 1, AGNOS→Linux).
- **The trap loop** — mirshi `fork`+`exec`s an agnos-target static ELF and traps
  **every** syscall it makes via `ptrace(PTRACE_SYSEMU)` on x86_64 Linux, decoding
  and logging the agnos syscall number + name + args. The host kernel executes
  none of the child's foreign-ABI syscalls; mirshi acts only on agnos `exit#0`
  (the program-exit that SYSEMU would otherwise suppress) to tear the child down
  and propagate its code.
  - `src/decode.cyr` — pure, side-effect-free decode: x86_64 `user_regs_struct`
    offsets, agnos number→name/arity/pointer-arg tables (all 0–35, 40–41, 45–61),
    and the `format_event` log-line renderer. Pointer args render `<ptr>` so logs
    are hermetic.
  - `src/intercept.cyr` — the fork/`PTRACE_TRACEME`/execve + `PTRACE_SYSEMU` wait
    loop, syscall-stop vs exit/signal classification, single-resume-site signal
    forwarding, and clean teardown. Defines the ptrace ABI the Linux stdlib peer
    lacks (`SYS_PTRACE`, `PTRACE_*`, `WIFSTOPPED`/`WSTOPSIG`). `wait4` is
    EINTR-retried and failure-guarded (a failed wait is never laundered into
    "child exited 0"), and the post-exec handshake is `WIFSTOPPED`-gated.
  - `src/main.cyr` — argv dispatch; `mirshi [--selftest-trace] <agnos-elf>`.
- `tests/fixtures/hi.cyr` (+ `hi.expected.log`) — the minimal agnos fixture
  (`getpid#2`, `write#1 "hi"`, `exit#0`) and its golden trapped stream.
- `tests/mirshi.tcyr` — pure-cyrius unit tests for the decode/format layer
  (hermetic; runs under `cyrius test`, no ptrace dependency).
- `scripts/it/m0_trap.sh` — integration test of the real fork+ptrace path; wired
  as a dedicated CI step after `cyrius test`.
- [ADR 0001](docs/adr/0001-ptrace-sysemu-intercept.md) — why `PTRACE_SYSEMU`
  (not `PTRACE_SYSCALL`, not seccomp-notify, not `LD_PRELOAD`) for M0.

### Changed
- `cyrius.cyml` — added `args` to `[deps].stdlib` (mirshi reads its own argv).
